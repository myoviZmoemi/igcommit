- **3D Footwear Design:** This module allows users to create realistic 3D models of any type of footwear, from sports shoes to boots, using a digital last as a reference. Users can draw directly on the 3D last, apply materials and accessories, and generate high-quality renderings of their designs. This module also integrates a 2D environment where users can obtain flattened patterns of their 3D models with pinpoint accuracy.
- **3D Last Design and Manufacturing:** This module enables users to edit and combine existing lasts or create new ones from scratch using 2D and 3D tools. Users can also import and export lasts in various formats and send them to a CNC machine for manufacturing.
- **Footwear Sole Design and Manufacturing:** This module facilitates the creation of different sole elements, such as outsoles, midsoles, and insoles, from a digitized last and through reverse engineering. Users can design complex soles with ease and print them in 3D using additive manufacturing technologies.
- **3D Anatomic Insole Design:** This module automates the tasks that are usually performed manually by podiatrists, such as insole design and manufacturing. Users can scan the foot of a patient, obtain a 3D model of the plantar surface, and design a customized insole that adapts to the foot shape and pathology.
- **Footwear Configurator:** This module allows users to display their footwear models in 3D and web-based platforms, as well as to offer their customers the possibility of combining different materials, colors, and textures in an instant and simple way.

3D Inescop footwear software is designed to speed up the footwear production process, reduce costs and waste, enhance creativity and quality, and adapt to the changing needs and preferences of the market. It is currently used by more than 1,700 companies in 39 countries around the world[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].

Some of the benefits of using 3D Inescop footwear software over traditional methods are:

1. **Time and cost savings:** 3D Inescop footwear software allows users to design and prototype footwear models in a fraction of the time and cost that it would take using physical materials and tools. Users can also make changes and modifications to their designs easily and instantly, without having to create new samples or waste resources.
2. **Creativity and quality enhancement:** 3D Inescop footwear software offers users a wide range of tools and options to create any type of footwear, from simple to complex, with realistic materials and effects. Users can also experiment with different combinations and variations of their designs, and obtain high-quality renderings and videos that showcase their work.
3. **Market adaptation and customer satisfaction:** 3D Inescop footwear software enables users to respond quickly and effectively to the changing demands and preferences of the market, as well as to offer their customers personalized and customized products. Users can also use the footwear configurator module to display their models online and allow their customers to interact with them and choose their preferred options.
4. **Technology integration and innovation:** 3D Inescop footwear software is compatible with various formats and devices, such as scanners, printers, CNC machines, smartphones, etc. Users can also benefit from the regular software updates and the most advanced technology available at any time. Moreover, 3D Inescop footwear software supports the integration of robotics and artificial vision technologies for automation and optimization of production processes[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
