A code calculator is a software tool that can generate the original activation code for your Blaupunkt RCD 300 car radio using its serial number. The serial number is a 14-digit code that you can find on the label of your radio. It usually starts with BP or CM.
 
To use a code calculator, you need to download it from a reliable website, such as [Radio Codes Calculator](https://www.radiocodescalculator.com/). This website offers a free and easy-to-use code calculator for Blaupunkt RCD 300 and many other car radio models. You just need to enter your serial number and click on the unlock button. The code will be displayed on your screen in seconds.
 
Once you have the code, you can enter it on your Blaupunkt RCD 300 car radio using the following steps:
 
1. Turn on your radio and wait for it to display "SAFE" or "CODE".
2. Press and hold the AS button until you hear a beep.
3. Use the preset buttons 1 to 4 to enter the four digits of your code. For example, if your code is 1234, press button 1 once, button 2 twice, button 3 three times, and button 4 four times.
4. Press and hold the AS button again until you hear another beep. Your radio should be unlocked and ready to use.

If you enter an incorrect code, your radio will display "SAFE" again and you will have to wait for a few minutes before trying again. If you enter an incorrect code three times in a row, your radio will lock permanently and you will need to visit a dealer or specialist to reset it.
 
Therefore, make sure you use a reliable code calculator and enter the correct serial number of your radio. If you have any problems with using the code calculator or entering the code, you can contact the customer support of [Radio Codes Calculator](https://www.radiocodescalculator.com/) for assistance.
